# jd3-rtests

This set of R files is aimed at providing an R interface for some routines of JD+ 3.0 in a very early stage of the development.
In that way, external teams will be able to make more easily tests and to provide feed-backs to the developers.

The current modules will probably constitute the basis of future R packages around JD+. However, they will change in a significant way during the next months.
So, they should be used only for testing purposes.

Users should refer to the Wiki for further information on the available routines
